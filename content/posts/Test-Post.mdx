Napoleon is a simple man of simple desires; he just wants to be really good at tetherball, learn how to draw really well, and impress Deb enough to maybe get a girlfriend. These are impossible dreams when everyone thinks he's a joke, right down to a random kid on the school bus.

That Napoleon doesn’t just constantly hit people in the face on a regular basis is a testament to his spiritual fortitude and mental acumen. [The hitting he reserves for Kip, who's not a very supportive brother](https://screenrant.com/best-worst-brother-relationships-tv/) and prefers the company of internet friends to his own flesh and blood.
